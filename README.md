# tbdateGenerator

Welcome friends to the TBDATE Random Quote Generator! Currently this is only able to be run on Windows machines, but potential for MacOS is being explored.

Simply download tbdateGenerator.exe and tbdate.txt (the program and the quotes), ensure they are saved in the same folder, and every time you run the program you will get a random quote selected from the file. 

At this point you are unable to add new lines to the file, but I'm exploring that possibility.

Full source code is available to view so you don't have to worry about any nefarious malware going on.

Have fun!
