# tbdateGenerator

Welcome friends to the TBDATE Random Quote Generator! Currently this is only able to be run on Windows machines, but potential for MacOS is being explored.

Simply download tbdateGenerator.exe and tbdate.txt (the program and the quotes), ensure they are saved in the same folder, and every time you run the program you will get a random quote selected from the file. 

If you want to add new quotes to the file, you'll have to edit the source code (.cpp) to ensure the random number generated can include the new lines.

Have fun!
